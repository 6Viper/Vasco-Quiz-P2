## Credits 
### Content 

- The text for the Home page was provided by myself and Vasco da Gama facts checked from general websites.

### Code 
This has been the most challeging so far, where the developer have used several sites and channels to better understand codes been used and how it properly works. Several learning projects reviewed such as Love-maths, Running project, Readme file ideas from Running project and Vasco Dublin, as informed before, developer has relied heavily on youtubers for this project as have choosen a Quiz much different then simple codes learned on previous lessons and simple "rock paper and scissor game". Developer have not simply copied codes from James Q Quick and instead learned from it's guide, for simples understanding of functions, inputs and get data developer have preffered "Bro Code" as much simpler explanations. Ralph from Six Minutes channel would provide a different approach and contribute as well. Links bellow:
